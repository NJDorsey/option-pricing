# Option Pricing Calculator

#### 12/29/2024
Added a GUI layer to allow users to dynamically enter input parameters and see call/put value outputs

#### 12/28/2024
This is (for now) an extremely simple Python REPL application that simply takes in the 5 inputs to an option's value (stock price, strike price, time to expiry, volatility, and interest rate) and spits out a Call and a Put value, based on the Black-Scholes pricing model. Interactive GUI layer will be next.
